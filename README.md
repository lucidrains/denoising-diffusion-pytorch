## Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model, in Pytorch

Implementation of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239">Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model</a> in Pytorch. It is a new approach to generative modeling that may <a href="https://ajolicoeur.wordpress.com/the-new-contender-to-gans-score-matching-with-langevin-sampling/">have the potential</a> to rival GANs. It uses denoising score matching to estimate the gradient of the data distribution, followed by Langevin sampling to sample from the true distribution.

This implementation was inspired by the official Tensorflow version <a href="https://github.com/hojonathanho/diffusion">here</a>

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/denoising-diffusion-pytorch.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/denoising-diffusion-pytorch)

## Install

```bash
$ pip install denoising_diffusion_pytorch
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from denoising_diffusion_pytorch import Unet, GaussianDiffusion

model = Unet(
    dim = 64,
    dim_mults = (1, 2, 4, 8),
    flash_attn = True
)

diffusion = GaussianDiffusion(
    model,
    image_size = 128,
    timesteps = 1000    # number of steps
)

training_images = torch.rand(8, 3, 128, 128) # images are normalized from 0 to 1
loss = diffusion(training_images)
loss.backward()

# after a lot of training

sampled_images = diffusion.sample(batch_size = 4)
sampled_images.shape # (4, 3, 128, 128)
```

Or, if you simply want to pass in a folder name and the desired image dimensions, you can use the `Trainer` class to easily train a model.

```python
from denoising_diffusion_pytorch import Unet, GaussianDiffusion, Trainer

model = Unet(
    dim = 64,
    dim_mults = (1, 2, 4, 8),
    flash_attn = True
)

diffusion = GaussianDiffusion(
    model,
    image_size = 128,
    timesteps = 1000,           # number of steps
    sampling_timesteps = 250    # number of sampling timesteps (using ddim for faster inference [see citation for ddim paper])
)

trainer = Trainer(
    diffusion,
    'path/to/your/images',
    train_batch_size = 32,
    train_lr = 8e-5,
    train_num_steps = 700000,         # total training steps
    gradient_accumulate_every = 2,    # gradient accumulation steps
    ema_decay = 0.995,                # exponential moving average decay
    amp = True,                       # turn on mixed precision
    calculate_fid = True              # whether to calculate fid during training
)

trainer.train()
```

Samples and model checkpoints will be logged to `./results` periodically

## Multi-GPU Training

The `Trainer` class is now equipped with <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/accelerator">ðŸ¤— Accelerator</a>. You can easily do multi-gpu training in two steps using their `accelerate` CLI

At the project root directory, where the training script is, run

```python
$ accelerate config
```

Then, in the same directory

```python
$ accelerate launch train.py
```

## Sampling Images from Saved Model Weights

After training the model, the model artifacts (checkpoints) will be saved in the `results` folder. The checkpoints are typically saved as `model-{epoch}.pt`, where `{epoch}` is the epoch number. Make sure to note the epoch number of the checkpoint you want to use for sampling.


Example Command Line Usage of `sampler.py`

```python
python script.py --num_samples 10 --image_path "\path\to\train_images" --train_load_num 44 --dim 32 --dim_mults 1 2 4 8 --sampling_timesteps 100 --batch_size 4 --image_size 128 --output_folder "\path\to\gen_images"

```


##### Required Arguments

* **`--num_samples`**: Number of images to generate (integer).
* **`--image_path`**: Path to the directory containing the training images (string). This folder should contain at least 100 images, as the trainer class checks this before initializing the model.
* **`--train_load_num`**: Checkpoint number to load the pre-trained model (integer). For example, if the checkpoint is `model-44.pt`, pass `44` for the `train_load_num` argument.
* **`--dim`**: Base dimension size for the U-Net model (integer). This should match the dimension used during training.
* **`--dim_mults`**: List of dimension multipliers for the U-Net (space-separated integers, e.g., `1 2 4 8`). This should be the same as used during training.

##### Optional Arguments

* **`--sampling_timesteps`**: Number of sampling timesteps (default: `100`, max: `1000`).
* **`--batch_size`**: Batch size for generation (default: `4`).
* **`--image_size`**: Size of the generated images (default: `128`, e.g., `128x128`). This should match the image size used during training.
* **`--output_folder`**: Folder to save the generated images (default: `gen_images`).

## Miscellaneous

### 1D Sequence

By popular request, a 1D Unet + Gaussian Diffusion implementation.

```python
import torch
from denoising_diffusion_pytorch import Unet1D, GaussianDiffusion1D, Trainer1D, Dataset1D

model = Unet1D(
    dim = 64,
    dim_mults = (1, 2, 4, 8),
    channels = 32
)

diffusion = GaussianDiffusion1D(
    model,
    seq_length = 128,
    timesteps = 1000,
    objective = 'pred_v'
)

training_seq = torch.rand(64, 32, 128) # features are normalized from 0 to 1

loss = diffusion(training_seq)
loss.backward()

# Or using trainer

dataset = Dataset1D(training_seq)  # this is just an example, but you can formulate your own Dataset and pass it into the `Trainer1D` below

trainer = Trainer1D(
    diffusion,
    dataset = dataset,
    train_batch_size = 32,
    train_lr = 8e-5,
    train_num_steps = 700000,         # total training steps
    gradient_accumulate_every = 2,    # gradient accumulation steps
    ema_decay = 0.995,                # exponential moving average decay
    amp = True,                       # turn on mixed precision
)
trainer.train()

# after a lot of training

sampled_seq = diffusion.sample(batch_size = 4)
sampled_seq.shape # (4, 32, 128)

```

`Trainer1D` does not evaluate the generated samples in any way since the type of data is not known.

You could consider adding a suitable metric to the training loop yourself after doing an editable install of this package
`pip install -e .`.
